-NO point of direct interaction with the VM, You need to run a Kali linux machine within the same network segment and try to hack into the CTF platform. 
-There are a total of 3 task, where you will be finding passwords using various techniques of Brute-force attack, creating password dictionaries and many more. 
-Navigate to the Website being hosted on the CTF platform to get 2 hint for each task.
